secaucus junction is a location from a world other than ours. in my head, it lies in this brief reprieve between new york and newark, an otherwise unremarkable stretch of grass and marsh. in particular i associate it with this abandoned building sitting atop a march by the tracks. a little hill covers the horizon line there too, so the only thing you can see peeking up is the newark city skyline nestled in between two slight slopes.

when i think about it, expands into something impossibly wide and impenetrably deep, backdropped by only the slightest hint of a mountain range.

i had a dream the other night where they'd driven me out for a summer to perform menial labor on-site. due to its remoteness there were no in-roads, so me and a few other hires took a maintenance train there. without knowing how the actual station looks on the inside i imagined it like this:

- the lobby is a single massive room. from a center atrium the room extends along two orthogonal axes, one a good bit longer than the other. the atrium is about 40? feet square, with a tall domed ceiling. and the extensions are, say, 150 and 220 feet (respectively) on either side.

- at its center, facing in two opposite directions, are these massive analog signboards displaying departures. there's a waiting room at its center, a few rows of long wooden seats.

- along the walls of the extensions are a few small stores - fast food, a hudson news situation, maybe some kitschy desserts, etc.

- the space itself has the same sort of ornate facade as something like grand central, or newark penn station.

- below the terminal space are two sets of tracks, one on top running along a cross (shorter) axis and one below running along the main (longer) axis. stairs along the extensions along with elevators take passengers down back to the tracks. regular metal pillars bridge floor to ceiling along the platform, with benches at regular (every 20 feet or so?) intervals.

on my last day on the job, i head down to the main axis track to head home, and i notice that a maintenance door is left open, one which i'd never seen anyone open. so i head down those winding passages, wandering aimlessly until i find an exit.

there's knee-high grass in all directions, all the way to the horizon. i start walking away from the station towards nothing in particular, walking until the electric hum of the station fades below the natural ambience, until the sun descends below the horizon, until the station lights disappear altogether.
