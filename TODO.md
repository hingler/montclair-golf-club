# todos
- (still need to generate green :D)
  - make huge on gaussian, handle from fairway map
  - GaussianGreenSampler (place a bunch of oblong samplers where we want the green to be)
    - need to smooth it out a TON (probably)
    - (how do we want to handle greens? i'll do it later :3)
      - might be best to handle after sampling is complete
- create splatmap from sand/fairway maps
  - fairway: rough/fairway/green based on meta ball dist
  - sand: threshold on sand sampler
- create flat "height map" for course
  - something we can eventually apply when we sample on course
  - verify generation, use splatmap as a shitty texture
- create gross-scale "heightmap" for terrain
  - verify generation at-scale, in engine (w/ fly camera)
- stamp course heightmap on top of it
  - smooth out slightly if necc, around course
  - fade out into general gen w distance
