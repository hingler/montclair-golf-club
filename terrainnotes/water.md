# water

## lakes
- isolated bodies of water placed along our course
- higher tier hazard than sand - should be sure to keep our distance, particularly from sand
- typ. large (ie no baby lakes)
- shouldn't encroach on "safe" fairway space (++ should leave a bit of "rough" space)

## rivers
- narrow - probably criss crossing patches of "safe" fairway.
  - (could put between two patches too, going larger - but this seems more "lake" - like)

## oceans
- very very large! flanking one side of the course (can avoid for now, probably)
